        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Climate Change refers to the shifts or changes in temperature and weather patterns in different parts of the planet. This may be due to natural causes, such as volcanic eruptions and changes in the sun’s activity. However, studies have shown that the main cause of this issue is human activities. In this age, climate change is commonly associated with the rise in Earth’s average temperature. Rising temperature means that it is getting warmer and hotter. Many people think that this is just the case. However, the rise in temperature is only the beginning of far worse effects and situations. It can heavily impact the people, their livelihood, and the environment. Because of its continuous threats and effects to society, climate change is easily one of the most known global issues that Mathematics in Action is trying to solve. Mathematical concepts, alongside scientific knowledge, continue to address this issue through several ways.

        <h1>Impact / Effects of Climate Change to the Environment and Society</h1>
   
        <h3>Drought and Water Scarcity</h3>
        <p>The rise in temperature caused by climate change makes dry regions or places even drier, increasing the risk for drought. Drought occurs when an area experiences little to no precipitation which may result in water shortages. When this happens, society is heavily affected. Water is a basic and an essential need in everyday survival. Humans and animals need water to survive. Crops and plants need water to grow. This phenomenon will lead to worse situations which can affect humans, animals, and the environment. </p>

        <h3>Health Issues</h3>
        <p>Rising emissions that cause climate change can cause the spread of different diseases such as malaria, dengue, and cholera. Additionally, water shortage due to climate change may result in issues such as food scarcity and pollution, affecting the community’s well-being. Pollution also plays a great role as this can harm the environment and the humans living in it. </p>

        <h3>Loss of Species</h3>
        <p>Climate change poses a risk to the survival of many species both on land and water. As temperature rises, the risk also increases. Animals may lose their habitat due to weather changes. Their source of food may also be affected as the environment degrades. Additionally, resources such as coral reefs are also vulnerable to this issue and may continue to decrease in number as climate change worsens.</p>

        <h3>Natural Disasters</h3>
        <p>Changes in temperature means changes in natural phenomena. As it gets worse, the amount of rainfall increases. Storms and typhoons become severe because of high ocean water temperatures. This may cause more frequent floods and landslides. Climate change also produces an environment that allows fires to spread faster. </p>

        <h1>Ways to combat climate change</h1>
        <p>
            Climate change may seem like a very complex issue that only the professionals can solve but in reality, even us, members of society, can contribute to address this. It may seem like a small and minor step but when combined, our group efforts matter. Our daily routines, practices, and lifestyles have a great impact on the world. From the electricity we consume to the way we travel, everything contributes to our carbon footprint, which is what causes climate change. Unconsciously, we continue to contribute to the worsening situation of our climate. The following are some of the ways on how we can improve and lessen our carbon footprint:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Save energy</li>
            <p>Be mindful of your electricity and water consumption. Turn off and unplug all appliances that are not in use. Moreover, do not waste water.</p>    
            <li>Switch to walking and biking</li>
            <p>If your destination is just around the corner, it is better to walk or bike instead of riding your private vehicle. If really necessary and applicable, opt to ride public transportation. This lessens our carbon footprint since we decrease our emission of greenhouse gases.</p>   
            <li>Reduce, Reuse, & Recycle</li>
            <p>The things we buy such as electronics, clothes, and other items cause carbon emissions at each point in production. To save and lessen this, we should keep our things and refrain from purchasing if it is not needed. By doing this, we are also able to lessen our waste.</p>   
            <li>Consider utilizing renewable energy</li>
            <p>Installing wind and solar panels to supply electricity is a great way to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions.</p>   
            <li>Be a responsible consumer</li>
            <p>One way to reduce carbon footprint is to choose wisely. In purchasing, we should ensure that the company or brand we are supporting are those who show effort in reducing their carbon emissions and waste. We can see this in their manufacturing processes and even in their product packaging.</p>   
            <li>Initiate</li>
            <p>Speaking up and sharing information are good but they are not enough. Many are aware of climate change but only a few choose to act on it. It may not be much but being a good example and a role model may inspire other people to do the same.</p>   
            
        </ul>

        <h1>Mathematics in combating climate change</h1>
        <p>The topics regarding logical reasoning and math in sciences, technology, humanities, and social sciences, are crucial parts in creating a holistic perspective to the understanding and mitigation of climate change. Assessment of numerous factors and mechanisms using mathematical and scientific methods has become a well-established approach in addressing societal issues. Mathematics provides a systematic approach for generating data through constructed mathematical models and instruments, as well as an objective method for data analysis. Mathematics plays a significant role in determining the nature of climate and its function by utilizing the laws of thermodynamics and pattern analysis This helps to foresee how the climate can alter over time and what implications it will have. The following are mathematical methods that help in solving climate change: </p>
